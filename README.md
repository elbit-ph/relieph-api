# Relief Management API
This repository contains Elbit's API for a Relief Management Application. 

## For developers (backend)
Kindly take note of the following best practices:
1. Use the following format for your branches' names:
- for issue solutions:  `<three letter initial>-<issue #>` e.g. `cjc-1`
- for hotfixes: `<three letter initial>-hotfix` e.g. `cjc-hotfix`
2. Each issue solution must have their own branch.
3. Always include a general title of the features you've added and a brief list of changes you've made.
4. As much as possible, stick to the sprint schedule to avoid further delay. An ideal state would be that we are ahead in terms of sprints compared to the front end so that they can use our API when needed.
5. Never push directly to main.
6. **SUPER IMPORTANT:** direct pull request to `staging`, not `main`.

## For users (front end developers)
Further instructions of use will be provided once a working alpha version is produced.
